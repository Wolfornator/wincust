### Is there support for other Operating Systems like macOS or Linux?

As a Linux user myself (i made this in a kvm), I can say that a Linux alternative is unneccesary due to linux having a lot of customization on it's own. Check out awesome-wm or KDE Plasma. 

Mac, on the other hand... I have no interest in working on (for this project atleast, I have other projects that work with macOS due to Unity Engine)
