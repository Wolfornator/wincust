# wincust
WinCust is a FOSS Windows Customizer that is a project for myself to work on. 
Be careful while using this, as it can cause your PC to not boot up or for it to be unstable.

# How do I build WinCust from source?

Clone the repository to C:\Program Files. *WHEN APPLYING THEMES, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP OF YOUR SYSTEM. IT IS IMPORTANT!

# How do I remove or reinstall Wincust?

2 ways

1. (being worked as an option in our settings, stay tuned!)

2. Open C:\Program Files\wincust\insopt-gui\WinCust.exe

# Is there a Linux/macOS version?

As a Linux user myself (i made this in a kvm), I can say that a Linux alternative is unneccesary due to linux having a lot of customization on it's own. Check out awesome-wm or KDE Plasma.
Mac, on the other hand... I have no experience in and have no interest in working on (for this project, I have other projects that work with macOS due to Unity Engine)

# How do you make these?

As this is a personal project of mine, I have no interest in integrading this as an official themes option in settings. What this app does is replace the source files and move them to C:\Program Files\WinCust_Themes (and doesn't delete from install, due to them being important files)
